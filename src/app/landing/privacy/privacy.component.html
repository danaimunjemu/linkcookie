      <p>What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data? When we need to process your Personal Data either to comply with law, perform the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with the functionalities of the Services). In this case, we may have to stop you from using our Services.</p>

      <h3>How We Use Cookies And Other Tracking Or Profiling Technologies</h3>
      <p>LinkCookie may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding your usage of the Services, including the pages and articles and presentations you viewed, time spent using certain features of the website, demographic data such as server locations, connection speed, and other information that does not identify you. Like most online services, we also use cookies, log files, clear GIFs, tracking pixels, web beacons, and other technologies that may collect Personal Data.</p>

      <h5>Cookies:</h5>
      <p>What are cookies? When you visit the Services, we may send one or more "cookies" – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and let AngelList help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you browse the Services to us so we can provide you with a more personalised experience. Still, it does not collect personal information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your computer after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.</p>
      <p>What cookies do we use? Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>

The information collected is aggregated and anonymous.

This data will only be used by us to provide you with the service you expect and will not be shared with any third parties.</p>

        <p>Do Not Track Signals: We do not currently respond to web browsers' "do not track" signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about users' activities on the Services and on other websites.
