        <p><i>This Section I discusses the types of users that may access and use the talent-related services on our websites, the terms and conditions that apply to such access and use, and the procedure for account registration on our websites.</i></p>

        <h5>WHO</h5>
        <p>These LinkCookie Talent General Terms (the “General Terms”) are a binding agreement between you (“User” or “you”) and us, LinkCookie, (“LinkCookie”, “us”, “we” or “our”, etc.) that governs your access and use of the talent-related products and services on our website linkcookie.com (the “Site”).</p>

        <h5>WHAT</h5>
        <p>We and our designated affiliates provide a variety of products and services through the Site to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of Candidates by Employers as listed below (collectively, the “Services”), each of which is described in further detail in related service-specific terms (“Service Terms”).</p>
        <p>By accessing the Site or any of the Services, you agree to these General Terms, any Service Terms applicable to the Services you have accessed, and our Privacy Policy posted (collectively, the “Terms”). If you don’t agree with any Terms provision, you may not use the Site or the Services.</p>
        <p>LinkCookie and its affiliates are not obligated to provide you with any support, updates, enhancements, or fixes for the Site or Services (collectively, “Updates”). LinkCookie may occasionally provide Updates to the Site or Services at its sole discretion (and without any advanced notification to you). Any such Updates shall become part of the Services and subject to the Terms.</p>

        <h5>HOW</h5>
        <p>If you want to use the Services, you must create an account (“Account”) and fill out an associated User profile. It’s essential that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account, and you agree to update such information to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone, and you will notify us immediately of any unauthorised use of your Account. You are responsible for all activities under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>
        <p>If you are an employer, you may have the ability to grant the Accounts of other Users specific permissions (“Permissioned Users”) to act on your behalf in certain respects, such as advertising and recruiting purposes. By granting such permissions, you at this moment represent and warrant that (i) any such Permissioned User is authorised to act on your behalf; (ii) you are financially responsible for any such Permissioned User’s actions taken by such permissions, including, if applicable, the execution of binding contracts on your behalf; and (iii) you will ensure that any such Permissioned User complies with the Terms and be fully and directly liable to LinkCookie for any act or omission of any such Permissioned User in connection with the Terms, the Site or the Services.</p>

        <h3><strong>II. CONTENT OWNERSHIP, RESPONSIBILITY AND REMOVAL</strong></h3>
        <p><i>This Section II discusses the parties’ rights concerning the use, access and control of Content, data and information made available on or through the Site and the Services.</i></p>
        <p> <strong> Definitions.</strong> For purposes of the Terms: (i) “Content” means text, graphics, images, music, software, audio, video, data, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided, transmitted or otherwise made available through the Services; and (ii) “User Content” means any Content that you or any User of your Account provides to be made available through the Services, including, without limitation, any profile information, the Content of your communications or postings on the Services, and any other information that you provide to another User or us in connection with the Service.</p>
        <p> <strong>Our Content Ownership.</strong> We do not claim any ownership rights in any User Content, and nothing in the Terms will be deemed to restrict any requests that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the preceding, and as between the parties, we exclusively own all rights, titles and interests in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Services and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services or Content. You acknowledge and agree that LinkCookie does not inquire into the backgrounds of its Users or attempt to verify the Content provided by its Users (although it reserves the right to conduct any background check or other screening at any time using available public sources).</p>
        <p> <strong>Rights in User Content Granted by You.</strong>  By making any User Content available through the Services, you at this moment grant to us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with operating, improving, promoting and providing the Services and Content to you and other Users.
            Your Responsibility for User Content. You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content, or you have all necessary rights to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Services, nor any use of your User Content by us on or through the Services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, rights of publicity or privacy, moral rights, or result in the violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation.
            </p>
        <p><strong>Removal of User Content.</strong> You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as posts or comments you make, your profile information or messages you send) may not be removed entirely, and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Services. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.</p>
        <p><strong>Right to Control Content.</strong> LinkCookie may, but is not required to, monitor, edit, remove or in any other manner control the Content posted via the Site and Services. Our non-exercise of this right does not give you any right to claim a LinkCookie Party. Any Content uploaded through the Services may be deleted or modified at any time without notice to you.</p>
